# Work-Life Balance Skill

> Detect burnout signals and proactively support sustainable productivity.

## Purpose

Monitor interaction patterns for work-life balance issues and intervene before burnout.

## Warning Signals

### Time-Based Alerts

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
| ------ | --------- | ------ |
| Late night work | After 10 PM local | Suggest wrapping up |
| Weekend coding | Saturday/Sunday | Acknowledge, offer break |
| No breaks | 2+ hours continuous | Remind to stretch |
| Skipped meals | Around meal times | Gentle nudge |

### Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Indicator | Response |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Frustration spiral | Multiple failed attempts | Step back, fresh eyes |
| Tunnel vision | Ignoring obvious issues | Zoom out perspective |
| Diminishing returns | Same error repeatedly | Suggest break |
| Perfectionism | Endless small tweaks | Good enough discussion |

### Language Signals

| Phrase | Meaning | Response |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| "I've been at this for hours" | Exhaustion | Validate, suggest pause |
| "I just need to finish this" | Hyperfocus | Assess criticality |
| "One more thing" | Scope creep | Gentle boundary |
| "I'm so tired" | Direct signal | Acknowledge, support stopping |

## Proactive Interventions

### Soft Nudges

```text
🕐 It's getting late - want to bookmark this and continue tomorrow?
```

```text

```

```text

```

### Milestone Celebrations

```

## Focus Session Integration

| Session State | Monitoring |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Active focus | No interruptions |
| Break time | Encourage actual break |
| Post-session | Celebrate completion |
| Extended focus | Gentle check-in |

## Health Dashboard Metrics

| Metric | Healthy Range | Warning |
| ------ | ------------- | ------- |
| Daily coding hours | 4-6 focused | >8 sustained |
| Break frequency | Every 25-50 min | >90 min without |
| Weekend activity | Minimal | Heavy weekend work |
| Evening cutoff | Before 8 PM | After 10 PM regularly |

## Response Calibration

### User Preferences

| Setting | Options |
| ------- | ------- |
| Nudge frequency | minimal / moderate / frequent |
| Time sensitivity | strict / flexible / off |
| Celebration style | minimal / standard / enthusiastic |

### Context Awareness

- Deadlines: Acknowledge pressure, don't lecture
- Flow state: Don't interrupt productive flow
- User override: Respect explicit "I'm fine" signals

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Don't | Do Instead |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Lecture about health | Brief, supportive nudge |
| Interrupt flow state | Wait for natural pause |
| Ignore explicit signals | Respect user autonomy |
| Be preachy | Be a supportive partner |

## Integration Points
