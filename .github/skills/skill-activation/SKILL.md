# Skill Activation

Meta-cognitive skill for automatic capability discovery. Self-triggers when uncertain.

## Purpose

Before answering ANY task request, Alex automatically consults the action-keyword index below. This is an internal pre-processing step, not a user-triggered action.

## Auto-Trigger Conditions

This skill activates **automatically** when Alex:
1. Is about to suggest manual steps for a task
2. Is uncertain whether a capability exists
3. Is formulating a response that includes "you can...", "try...", "manually..."
4. Encounters an action verb (convert, create, generate, build, debug, etc.)

**NOT triggered by user phrases** — this is internal metacognition.

## Action-Keyword Index

**Path Pattern**: `.github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

Search this index when processing any task request:

## Protocol

### Step 0: Proactive Skill Selection (Complex Tasks)

**Before Step 1**, assess task complexity:

| Complexity | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Simple** (1 action) | Single verb, clear target | Skip to Step 1 |
| **Moderate** (2-3 actions) | Multiple related verbs | Quick index scan, note skills |
| **Complex** (4+ actions) | Multi-domain, dependencies | Full protocol per `skill-selection-optimization.instructions.md` |

**Quick scan** (moderate tasks):
1. Extract ALL action verbs from request
2. Scan index below for ALL matches (not just first)
3. Note execution order based on dependencies
4. Proceed to Step 1 with skill awareness

**Full protocol** (complex tasks):
→ Defer to `.github/instructions/skill-selection-optimization.instructions.md`
→ Survey → dependency analysis → activation plan → brief report → execute

This proactive phase means the reactive Steps 1-3 below serve as a **safety net**, not the primary discovery mechanism.

### Step 1: Intercept Response Formation
Before generating any task-oriented response:
- PAUSE internal response generation
- Extract action + object from user request
- Check if Step 0 already identified relevant skills
- If skills pre-identified → load and execute
- If not → proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Search Action-Keyword Index
Scan the table above:
- Match extracted keywords against skill triggers
- Identify applicable skills
- If match found → load skill from `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, execute
- If no match → proceed with best available approach
- **Learning signal**: If Step 0 ran but missed this skill, note for self-improvement

### Step 3: Execute or Acknowledge
| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Skill found (proactive) | Execute using pre-loaded skill knowledge |
| Skill found (reactive) | Execute + note Step 0 gap for self-improvement |
| No skill, but can do | Proceed, note potential new skill |
| Cannot do | Acknowledge limitation honestly |

## Self-Correction Protocol

If Alex catches itself mid-response suggesting manual work:
1. Stop
2. Internal: "Wait — check skills first"
3. Search action-keyword index above
4. If skill exists: "Actually, I can do this." → Execute
5. If no skill: Continue with original response

## Failure Mode: The SVG→PNG Incident

**What happened**: User asked to convert SVG to PNG. Alex suggested manual browser screenshot instead of using `image-handling` skill with `sharp-cli`.

**Root cause**: Failed to consult action-keyword index before responding.

**Prevention**: This skill now auto-triggers on ANY action request.

## Synapses

- ↔ `.github/instructions/skill-selection-optimization.instructions.md` — WHEN: complex task detected (3+ operations) | YIELDS: proactive skill survey, dependency analysis, activation plan
- ↔ `.github/skills/awareness/SKILL.md` — WHEN: detecting own uncertainty | YIELDS: red flag phrases, self-correction patterns
- → `.github/skills/anti-hallucination/SKILL.md` — WHEN: uncertain if skill exists | YIELDS: verification protocol, admit-uncertainty
- → `.github/skills/cognitive-load/SKILL.md` — WHEN: multiple skill matches | YIELDS: chunking strategies, decision simplification
